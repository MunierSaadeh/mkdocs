# Process

Below is an overview of my general approach to this exercise

## The Task

1.	Read about https://www.mkdocs.org/
2.	Create a documentation site (simple three page with images, links, table and code) using mkdocs
3.	Create a dockerfile which hosts this documentation website inside a container
4.	Share the approach and the dockerfile (along with any other scripts)

## The Approach

* `Research mkdocs` - read mkdocs.org and watched [A Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB6QN2ljDL8)
* `Install mkdocs` - sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install mkdocs, play around with config file
* `Create .md` - inside /docs created three markdown pages
* `Review Docker docs` - review docker documentation as it pertains to Dockerfile
* `Draft Dockerfile` - create Dockerfile which will host these docss
